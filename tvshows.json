The latest original, animated comedy series from Cartoon Network Studios, The Powerpuff Girls premieres with back-to-back episodes on Monday, April 4 at 6 p.m. (ET, PT). Following this premiere are two action-packed weeks of new episodes (Monday-Friday, April 4 through 15 at 6 p.m. ET, PT), leading into the show's regular time slot, Thursdays at 6 p.m. (ET, PT), on April 21. The Powerpuff Girls will kick off its global return to television with a world premiere event on Monday, March 14 at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Tex. This fan-centric experience will feature a world premiere screening, pre-party and parade with giant-balloon likenesses of all three Powerpuff Girls. Fast on the heels of the U.S. event, premieres will commence in regions around the globe including Europe, Asia and Latin America. Superhero sisters Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup are known to their fellow citizens of Townsville as The Powerpuff Girls. Together, they protect their beautiful, bustling metropolis from sinister evildoers, intent on taking over. Juggling school, homework and a regular parade of villains is no easy task, but The Powerpuff Girls are more than up to the challenge. Armed with supercool superpowers and some topnotch teamwork, The Powerpuff Girls, with occasional assistance from Professor Utonium and the Mayor of Townsville, show their hometown and the world that it is possible to save the world before bedtime.</p>", "episodes": [{"id": 657308, "url": "http://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/657308/the-powerpuff-girls-1x01-escape-from-monster-island", "name": "Escape from Monster Island", "season": 1, "number": 1, "airdate": "2016-04-04", "airtime": "18:00", "airstamp": "2016-04-04T22:00:00+00:00", "runtime": 11, "image": {"medium": "http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_landscape/53/132617.jpg", "original": "http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/53/132617.jpg"}, "summary": "<p>Bubbles wins two tickets to a concert and has to pick between Blossom and Buttercup to go with her.

Someone has planted a fake murder scene at the front of Doose's market, complete with police tape and the chalk outline of a body. Naturally, this gets Taylor in a dither; after scouring Stars Hollow looking for the culprit, he confronts Luke at the diner and accuses Jess. Luke jumps to Jess's defense and throws Taylor out. Later that evening, Luke, Lorelai, Rory and Mia stumble upon a secret town meeting where Jess is accused once more and Luke is vilified for bringing him into town. Luke stands behind his nephew again, supported by Lorelai. The next day, Rory tells Jess that she knows he's really the culprit, and that he's being a jerk for letting Luke take all the heat from everyone in Stars Hollow. After Jess gets her to admit that it was a pretty funny prank after all, he agrees to lighten up and be more considerate of Luke's feelings.</p>"}, {"id": 47516, "url": "http://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/47516/gilmore-girls-2x09-run-away-little-boy", "name": "Run Away, Little Boy", "season": 2, "number": 9, "airdate": "2001-11-27", "airtime": "21:00", "airstamp": "2001-11-28T02:00:00+00:00", "runtime": 60, "image": {"medium": "http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_landscape/87/217605.jpg", "original": "http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/87/217605.jpg"}, "summary": "<p>Lorelai receives a late wedding present without a card attached, and insists that it be returned. Sookie sees to what great lengths Lorelai is going to find out who sent it, and tells Lorelai to move forward in life to get some closure on her relationship with Max. Lorelai takes her advice and accepts a dinner date with Paul, one of the other students in her business class. The date goes well, but they decide to remain friends because they don't have very much in common. When Paul appears at Luke's the following Saturday with his parents in tow, Lorelai gets ribbed by everyone in town because he's so young. Luke is uncharacteristically quiet, which Lorelai can't figure out until Sookie explains that he's had a crush on Lorelai forever. Lorelai goes to him to let him know that he'll always be a very important part of her life, and Luke brightens up again. Rory, Paris, Madeline and Louise are assigned to present the death scene from \"Romeo and Juliet\" as part of ther class participation in the Chilton Shakespearean Festival. Since this production will account for half of their grade, Paris takes over as director and assigns Rory the role of Juliet. Tristan returns to school with Duncan and Bowman after their suspension, and is cast as Romeo against Rory's wishes. When a scheduling mixup occurs with the rehearsal hall, Rory is horrified to learn that Paris has rented Miss Patty's studio and that the group will convene in Stars Hollow to practice. Tristan wastes no time in going to the market and taunting Dean, and they nearly come to blows before Rory pulls them apart. The next day at school, Rory pleads with Tristan not to mention anything to Dean about their kiss at the party, because it meant nothing to her. She also cautions him about hanging out with Duncan and Bowman. Stung by her words, but hiding it well, Tristan storms off. The next day Dean shows up to watch rehearsal and Tristan taunts both Dean and Rory before he finally bails to go off with Duncan and Bowman. On the evening of the performance, Paris freaks out because Tristan is nowhere to be found. He finally shows up to tell Rory that his father has pulled him out of Chilton to send him to boarding school, because he was caught with Duncan and Bowman breaking into Bowman's father's safe on a lark. Paris storms off, puts on his costume, and takes over as Romeo, thereby saving the day, the performance, and their grades.</p>"}, {"id": 47517, "url": "http://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/47517/gilmore-girls-2x10-the-bracebridge-dinner", "name": "The Bracebridge Dinner", "season": 2, "number": 10, "airdate": "2001-12-11", "airtime": "21:00", "airstamp": "2001-12-12T02:00:00+00:00", "runtime": 60, "image": {"medium": "http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_landscape/87/217606.jpg", "original": "http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/87/217606.jpg"}, "summary": "<p>A blizzard prevents a group from attending the historical dinner that Sookie has painstakingly prepared at their request, so she and Lorelai decide to invite all their friends in Stars Hollow to enjoy the feast at the Inn.
